OpenCV Installation:
	sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev opencv-doc --fix-missing

Should be as simple as running 'make' and then 'sudo ./capture'

If you wish to utilize the printing of information, then you need to utilize 'make -f WithPrintf', as that will print error information at runtime, something that should be removed in the final build, hence the two separate makefiles

If wanting to recompile at any point, simply run 'make -B'
